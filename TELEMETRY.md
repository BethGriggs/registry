Metrics include data such as:

* Usage information regarding components, features and extensions
* A unique random identifier generated during a visit used solely to identify the number of unique users of the software
* Country/region information derived from a browser's language setting and **not** based on a user's IP address

# Third Party Service Providers

Red Hat uses certain third party service providers to collect the telemetry data.

# Security

Red Hat employs technical and organizational measures designed to protect the telemetry data.

Red Hat does not intend to collect personal information.

# Opting out of Telemetry Data Collection

The Devfile Registry, being a public, anonymous use service does not provide the option to disable telemetry.    
For users of local clients such as ODO or Openshift Developer Console, the decision to opt-out will be made in those tools and will be respected across the integration
